Modules implemented in my program:

Modules Used in ALL TASKS:

pgmRead.c: This module will read the data of pgm file. This file will check magic number, dimension, gray value and image data.
	   Functions in pgmRead.c:
           void scanForWhiteSpace()
	   int readCommentAndCheck()
	   void getMagicNumber()
           int readImageData()
	   int readFile()
	   int readImageDataBinary()
	   int checkIfInputFileEmpty()
	   int checkIfValidMagicNumber()
	   int printBadCommentLineError()
	   int checkWidthHeightMaxGrayAreValid()
	   Header Files: FileInfo.h 

pgmWrite.c: This module will write the pgm image in ASCII as well as Binary but depends on the give condition.
	    Functions in pgmWrite.c:
	    int writeToFile()
	    int writeASCIIDataInBinary()
	    int writeASCIIPropertyONLY()
	    int writeReducedASCII()
	    int writeASCIIPropertyBasedOnParameters()
	    int writeASCIIDataInBinaryReduced()
	    int writeBetweenMaxMin()
	    int writeBetweenMaxMinBinary()
	    Header Files: FileInfo.h 

TASK 1: pgmEcho.c

pgmEcho.c: Reads the pgm File with the function in pgmRead.c modules and writes the file with the function in pgmWrite.c.
	   This modules also checks if the argument count is correct or not.
	   Header Files: pgmCompare.h : pgmRead.h and pgmWrite.h

TASK 2: pgmComp.c

pgmComp.c: Reads the two pgm files with the functions in pgmRead.c and compares if the images are identical or not.
	   This modules also checks if the argument count is correct or not.
           The comparision of two pgm Images is done by the function in pgmCompare.c.

pgmCompare: PgmCompare has the function that compares two pgm Images.
	    Header Files: pgmCompare.h  


Task 3: pgma2b.c & pgmb2a.c

pgma2b.c: Reads the ASCII file with pgmRead.c and converts the ASCII file into Binary with functions in pgmWrite.c
	  This modules also checks if the argument count is correct or not.
	  Header Files: pgmRead.h and pgmWrite.h

pgma2b.c: Reads the Binary file with pgmRead.c and converts the Binary file into ASCII with functions in pgmWrite.c
	  This modules also checks if the argument count is correct or not.
	  Header Files: pgmRead.h and pgmWrite.h

Task 4: pgmReduce.c

pgmReduce.c: Reads the pgmFile with pgmRead.c and reduces the file size with the given integer factor.
	     This modules also checks if the argument count is correct or not.
	     Header Files: pgmRead.h and pgmWrite.h

Task5: pgmTile.c

pgmTile.c: Reads the pgmFile with pgmRead.c and divides the pgmFile into nxn smaller images.
       	   This modules also checks if the argument count is correct or not.
	   Header Files: pgmRead.h and pgmWrite.h


Task6: pgmAssemble.c

pgmAssemble.c: Reads the smaller pgmFiles with pgmRead.c and assembles into a larger image.
	       This modules also checks if the argument count is correct or not.
	       Header Files: pgmRead.h pgmWrite.h
